CONTAINS ALTERNATE TEXTURES.
To use the Alternate Textures (in this case, for the Shield), delete Shield.dds, and make a copy of the new desired texture. Then, rename it to Shield.dds

Shield.dds is the original texture, Team Color on the Shield, Yellow Star of David.
ShieldALT1.dds is a reddish-orange shield with a Team Color Star of David.
ShieldAlt2.dds is a reddish-orange shield. There is no Team Color on this one.
ShiledORG.dds is a backup of the original texture, Team Color on the Shield, Yellow Star of David.


Made by taking the unit from Capo's Maccabee (which is a reskinned version of Bakuel's Hebrew Axeman) and putting it on the Charlemagne Heavy Spearman skeleton. I then had to do a little bit of NifSkope UV Editing, as the new skeleton warped the texture on the unit's chest armor. Then, I used "Scale Vertices" to make the spear much shorter (it was only 4 feet long in reality). I used the Mali Skirmisher's "Idle" animation, as the old pikeman style idle animation wasn't very suitable. And finally, with a little bit of NifViewer and .dds editing magic, I added Team Color to the units. The Team Color is on the Headband for the spearman, and on the shield (except the Star of David).
